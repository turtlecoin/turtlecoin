   block hash, but if this block was on a forked chain, we would have to
   discard all our progress, and begin again from the genesis block.

   Instead, we store the last 100 block hashes we know about (since forks
   are most likely going to be quite shallow forks, usually 1 or 2 blocks max),
   and then we store one hash every 5000 blocks, in case we have a very
   deep fork.
   
   Note that the first items in this vector are the latest block. On the
   daemon side, it loops through the vector, looking for the hash in its
   database, then returns the height it found. So, if you put your earliest
   block at the start of the vector, you're just going to start syncing from
   that block every time. */
